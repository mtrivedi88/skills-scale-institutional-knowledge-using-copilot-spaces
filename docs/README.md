# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the central hub for OctoAcme project management documentation. This README provides a quick overview of our processes and links to all supporting documents.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a **structured five-phase project lifecycle** grounded in customer-first principles, iterative delivery, clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Every project moves through the following phases:

| Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Initiation** | Validate business need and stakeholder alignment via a lightweight Project One-pager |
| **Planning** | Break work into shippable increments with prioritized backlogs and acceptance criteria |
| **Execution** | Maintain day-to-day team rhythm through standups, weekly syncs, and GitHub Projects tracking |
| **Release & Deployment** | Meet standardized pre-release requirements including CI/security scans and smoke tests |
| **Close & Retrospective** | Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements |

---

## Key Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Project Manager** | Coordinates delivery and keeps the team unblocked |
| **Product Manager** | Defines what to build and owns the prioritized backlog |
| **Developers** | Implement features and maintain code quality |
| **QA / Testing** | Validates quality through testing at every phase |

---

## Communication Cadence

- **Twice-weekly standups** — share progress, surface blockers
- **Weekly delivery syncs** — review sprint health and upcoming work
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** — communicate status and decisions
- **Ad-hoc escalations** — address critical blockers outside the regular cadence

---

## Quality & Risk Management

Quality is embedded throughout the lifecycle:

- Unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests
- Security scanning on every pull request
- Small, focused PRs (≤ 400 lines)
- Risk Register reviewed at each phase gate
- Retrospectives conducted after every sprint, release, or milestone — producing 2–3 prioritized action items
