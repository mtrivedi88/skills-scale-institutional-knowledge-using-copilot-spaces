# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Tech Lead, UX Designer, Solution Architect)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (UX acceptance criteria owned by UX Designer)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points (Solution Architect leads cross-system dependency review)
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
